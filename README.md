# Welcome to Frag-A-Frigate!

A browser-based implementation of the classic boardgame Battleship by Milton Bradley.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Setting up the game:

Instead of the usual method of placing an entire ship at a time while setting up your board, you will
place each "cell" of a given ship one by one. The program will let you know if you are placing a cell
illegally. The program will prompt you once you have placed all of your pieces correctly, and you will
be allowed to initiate the game.

## Gameplay:

Once the game is initiated, the program will randomly populate an opponent computer board with ship. It 
is up to you to select cells on this board to find out where the computer's ships are placed. Once you 
have destroyed all of the computer's ships, the game will prompt you for a rematch.

Note: The computer will automatically make guesses to try and find your ships, though the logic is 
literally random. If you lose a game to this bot, then I feel very bad for you.

## ENJOY!
